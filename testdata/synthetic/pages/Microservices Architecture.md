- # Microservices Architecture
-
- ## Overview
	- Architectural style for building distributed systems
	- Used in: [[Project Phoenix]], [[Observability Stack]]
	- Team expertise: [[Sarah Chen - Tech Lead]], [[DevOps Team]]
-
- ## Key Concepts
	- Service boundaries
	- Data ownership
	- API contracts
	- Event-driven communication
	- See: [[Event Sourcing]]
-
- ## Our Stack
	- Language: [[Go]] for services
	- Frontend: [[React]] + [[TypeScript]]
	- Container orchestration: [[Kubernetes]]
	- Service mesh: Istio
	- Message queue: RabbitMQ
	- Database: [[PostgreSQL]] per service
-
- ## Communication Patterns
	- Synchronous:
		- [[REST API]] for simple requests
		- [[GraphQL]] for complex queries
		- gRPC for service-to-service
	- Asynchronous:
		- Event bus for domain events
		- Message queues for background jobs
		- Webhooks for external integrations
-
- ## Service Catalog
	- [[Authentication Service]]
	- [[User Analytics]] service
	- [[API Gateway]]
	- Notification service
	- Billing service
	- [[Mobile App]] BFF (Backend for Frontend)
-
- ## Challenges & Solutions
	- Distributed tracing: [[Distributed Tracing]] with OpenTelemetry
	- Service discovery: Kubernetes DNS + Istio
	- Configuration management: ConfigMaps + Secrets
	- Monitoring: [[Observability Stack]]
	- Testing: Contract tests + integration tests
-
- ## Migration Strategy
	- From monolith to microservices
	- Strangler fig pattern
	- See: [[Database Migration]] strategy
	- Timeline: 18 months
-
- ## Best Practices
	- Single responsibility per service
	- Database per service pattern
	- API versioning from day 1
	- See: [[API Design Best Practices]]
	- Chaos engineering for resilience
	- Circuit breakers and bulkheads

-
- ## Action Items
	- TODO Document [[Authentication Service]] API contract
	- DOING Implement [[Distributed Tracing]] across all services
	- LATER Evaluate service mesh alternatives
	- LATER Create runbook for common failure scenarios
