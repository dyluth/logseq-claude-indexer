- # User Analytics
-
- ## Overview
	- Real-time analytics engine for [[Project Phoenix]]
	- Tracks user behavior and system metrics
	- Powers dashboards in web app and [[Mobile App]]
-
- ## Architecture
	- Data ingestion: Event streaming via Kafka
	- Processing: Apache Flink
	- Storage: ClickHouse (OLAP)
	- Query layer: [[GraphQL]] API
	- Visualization: Custom [[React]] dashboards
-
- ## Metrics Tracked
	- User engagement:
		- Daily/Monthly Active Users (DAU/MAU)
		- Session duration
		- Feature usage
		- Conversion funnels
	- System performance:
		- API latency (p50, p95, p99)
		- Error rates
		- Throughput
	- Business metrics:
		- Revenue per user
		- Churn rate
		- Customer acquisition cost
-
- ## Implementation
	- Event schema: JSON with Avro validation
	- Real-time: <5 second latency
	- Retention: 90 days hot, 2 years cold
	- Privacy: PII scrubbing, GDPR compliance
-
- ## Dashboard Features
	- Real-time metrics
	- Custom date ranges
	- Segment filtering
	- Export to CSV/PDF
	- Scheduled reports
	- See: [[User Analytics - Dashboard Design]]
