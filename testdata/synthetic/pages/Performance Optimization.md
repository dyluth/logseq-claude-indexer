- # Performance Optimization
-
- ## Philosophy
	- Measure first, optimize second
	- Focus on user-perceived performance
	- Don't sacrifice maintainability for marginal gains
	- Document all optimizations
-
- ## Key Metrics
	- Backend:
		- API latency: <200ms p95 (target for [[Project Phoenix]])
		- Throughput: 10k req/sec
		- Database query time: <50ms p95
	- Frontend:
		- Time to Interactive (TTI): <3s
		- First Contentful Paint (FCP): <1.5s
		- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): <2.5s
	- Mobile ([[Mobile App]]):
		- Cold start: <2s
		- Screen transitions: <100ms
		- Network requests: <500ms p95
-
- ## Backend Optimization
	- Caching:
		- Redis for hot data
		- CDN for static assets
		- HTTP caching headers
	- Database:
		- Query optimization
		- Index tuning
		- Connection pooling
		- Read replicas for [[PostgreSQL]]
	- API:
		- Batch endpoints
		- [[GraphQL]] query complexity limits
		- Response compression
		- See: [[API Design Best Practices]]
-
- ## Frontend Optimization
	- Bundle optimization:
		- Code splitting
		- Tree shaking
		- Lazy loading
	- Rendering:
		- Virtual scrolling
		- Memoization
		- Web Workers for heavy computation
	- Network:
		- Prefetching
		- Service Workers
		- Resource hints
-
- ## Infrastructure
	- Horizontal scaling with [[Kubernetes]]
	- Auto-scaling based on load
	- Geographic distribution
	- Load balancing
	- See: [[Microservices Architecture]]
-
- ## Monitoring
	- APM: Application Performance Monitoring
	- Real User Monitoring (RUM)
	- Synthetic monitoring
	- [[Observability Stack]] integration
	- [[Distributed Tracing]]
-
- ## Profiling Tools
	- Backend:
		- [[Go]] pprof
		- Database EXPLAIN ANALYZE
		- Load testing with k6
	- Frontend:
		- Chrome DevTools
		- Lighthouse
		- WebPageTest
	- Mobile:
		- Xcode Instruments
		- Android Profiler
-
